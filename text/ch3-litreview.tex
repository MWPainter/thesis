\chapter{\label{ch:3-litreview}Literature Review}

    \minitoc

    \todo{currently this is a copy and paste of what I originally wrote for background chapter} \ref{ch:2-background}. Deleted parts which are irrelevant for litreview here (and vice versa for the background section).

    \todo{I'm also going to use this as a space to paste papers I should write about as they come up while writing later chapters}

\section{Multi-Armed Bandits}
\label{sec:3-0-mab}

    \todo{Maybe dont need to cover this in litrev, but should talk about exploring bandits, UCT and contextual bandits either in background or in litrev}

\section{Reinforcement Learning}
\label{sec:3-1-rl}

    \todo{Intro should say that look at Sutton and Barto and something else for deep RL, for a more complete overview. 
    Here we will just discuss papers that consider entropy in their work, as thats the most relevant part for this 
    thesis.}


    \todo{list}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Talk about entropy and some of that work (probably a subsection)
    \end{itemize}

\section{Trial-Based Heuristic Tree Search and Monte-Carlo Tree Search}
\label{sec:3-2-thts}

    \subsection{Trial Based Heuristic Tree Search}
    \label{sec:3-2-1-thts}

    \todo{THTS paper}

    \subsection{Monte-Carlo Tree Search}
    \label{sec:3-2-2-mcts}

        \todo{list}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Talk about the things that are ambiguous from literature (e.g. people will just say UCT, which originally presented doesn't run in \mctsmode, but often assumed it does)
            \item Should talk about multi-armed bandits here?
        \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Maximum Entropy Tree Search}
    \label{sec:3-2-3-ments}

    \todo{MENTS}

\section{Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning}
\label{sec:3-3-morl}

    \todo{list}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Should talk about multi-objective and/or contextual multi-armed bandits here?
        \item Bunch of the work covered in recent MORL survey \cite{morl_survey}
        \item Mention some deep MORL stuff, say that this work (given AlphaZero) is adjacent work
    \end{itemize}

\section{Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search}
\label{sec:3-4-momcts}

    \todo{I think this whole section can just go in litrev}

    \todo{list}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Define the old methods (using the CH object methods, so clear that not doing direct arithmetic)
        \item Mention that old method could be written using the arithmetic of CHMCTS (but they don't) 
        \item TODO: write about \& make sure its implemented - its because just updating for 1 is more efficient in deterministic, and say that the additions can be implemented as updating for 1 value when determinstic
        \item Different flavours copy UCT action selection, but with different variants
        \item Link back to contributions and front load our results showing that all of the old methods don't explore correctly
    \end{itemize}

\section{Sampling Random Variables}
\label{sec:3-5-sampling}

    \todo{Just citing the alias method papers?}
