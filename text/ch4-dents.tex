\chapter{\label{ch:4-dents}Monte Carlo Tree Search With Boltzmann Exploration} 

    \minitoc

    This chapter discusses MCTS algorithms for planning in single-objective environments whose search policies take the form of Boltzmann distributions. Primarily, this chapter aims to answer question \entropyq, while laying the foundation to answer \contextq\ewe in Chapter \ref{ch:6-simplexmaps}.

    \end{figure}

    Figure \ref{fig:4:rl_overview} gives the exploration setting for reinforcement learning, where the agent is only assessed on the recommendations that it provides, and is not penalised for considering poor actions in the simulator. 

    This chapter will also consider how entropuy can be used as an auxilary secondary objective to encourage exploration. Entropy is already used widely in the reinforcement literature \todo{cites, ppo, sac etc, ref ch3}, and is often cited for its \bd{exploration, and robustness to uncertainty, and robustness to simulator/environment differences, and robustness to noise.} 

    When considering the maximum entropy reinforcement learning objective (\todo{ref}), the optimal policy (equation (\todo{ref})) naturally takes the form of a Boltzmann policy. Notably, MENTS (Section \ref{sec:2-4-3-ments}), and RENTS and TENTS (Section \todo{ref litrev}) are existing MCTS algorithms for the maximum entropy setting (Section \ref{sec:2-3-1-merl}), so will be discussed further in this chapter, along with UCT (Section \todo{ref}), and used as baseline algorithms.

    Section \ref{sec:4-1-intro} discusses limitations of existing MCTS algorithms in this exploration setting, motivating the work covered in the remainder of the chapter. Additionally, the planning framework is defined so that the algorithms can be theoretically analysed using \textit{simple regret}.
    
    In Section \ref{sec:4-2-boltzmannsearch} the \textit{Boltzmann Tree Search} and \textit{Decaying ENtropy Tree Search} algorithms are defined.

    Section \ref{sec:4-3-toyenvs} considers some theoretical MDPs, which are used to empirically demonstrate the limitations of the existing MCTS algorithms, and are used for constructive proofs of some theorems. 

    Results on grid world and the game of Go are given in section \ref{sec:4-4-results}. 

    Finally, in Section \ref{sec:4-5-theory} the main theoretical analysis and proofs are given.

\section{Introduction and Motivation}
\label{sec:4-1-intro}

    UCT \todo{ref} \bd{is designed in the traditional reinforcement learning setting (todo ref Fig 2.5), minimising the cumulative regret (todo ref)}, and so UCT makes a trade off between exploration and exploitation. As such, UCT will frequently choose the same action to exploit, which results in it getting stuck in local optima when \bd{rewards are sparse or not informative.}

    To see this consider two grid world MDPs which differ only in the reward function. \todo{state space is (x,y,time), actions are cardinal directions etc}. The first reward function is to use a constant cost of $R_1(s,a)=-1$, and the second is a sparse version where the time cost is only revealed at the end $R_2((x,y,t),(x_a,y_a)) = -(t+1)\one[(x,y)+(x_a,y_a)==G]$. \todo{clean and actually define goal state, and name bettwer than R1 and R2}

    \todo{make diagram}

    \todo{something that says although this example can be solved by using the more sensible reward, it's just to highlight the issue of exploration}.
    
    \todo{would like to have figs showing the best path found by UCT in both cases AND showing the number of trials (one step of branches) where it explored.}

    Although the issues in the above toy problem can be resolved by using the simpler constant reward $R_1$, the example serves to highlight that UCT performs best when provided with a dense and informative reward. 
    
    As we are considering the exploration setting given in Figure \ref{fig:4:rl_overview}, this example shows in the sparse reward setting that UCT will use most of its available computation time exploiting the same sub-optimal solution that it has already found. As the objective is to provide the best recommendations to the user, it would be desirable to better utilise this computation time exploring alternative solutions. \todo{reword this sect, not super hapy with it }

    \todo{some comment somewhere that although it does seem a little unfair to compare UCT in a scenario for which it was not designed, in practise it is used in these cases}

    This example is extended upon in Section \todo{ref} where the performance of algorithms discussed in this chapter are compared on mixtures of these two rewards.





    Now that some limitations of UCT have been discussed, lets now consider the maximum entropy objective. When using the maximum entropy objective it is often argued that the standard objective can be recovered by setting $\alpha=0$, or setting $\alpha$ to an infitesimally small values ($0<\alpha<<1$). \todo{add refs} \todo{add the words ``temperature'' somewhere}

    However, in practise setting $\alpha$ to some tiny value will nullify any advantages that can be obtained from using entropy to promote exploration. Considering the other extreme, if we allowed a very large value of $\alpha$ (or let $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$), then maximising entropy becomes the dominant objective and the `optimal' policy will be a uniformly random one. Thus there is some tradeoff that needs to be made. When using a maximum entropy method the temperature parameter needs to be tuned: which intuitively should be made as large as possible, so as to obtain as much benefit from entropy exploration; while keeping it small enough such that policy acts as desired (i.e. it maximises the standard objective).

    \todo{supp expr on gridworld shortest path problem, where vary alpha value}

    In Figure \todo{ref}, the performance of MENTS (\todo{ref}) on the above gridworld problem with sparse reward is considered (Figure \todo{ref}). As the value of $\alpha$ is increased from zero, it can be seen the shortest path is found with fewer and fewer trials initially. Then, above a threshold value of \todo{quote value}, MENTS can gain more ``reward'' by acting randomly and optimising for entropy, largely ignoring the rewards from the MDP. This example empirically demonstrates an issue with using the maximum-entropy objective, where the temperature parameter needs to be finely tuned to a sweet-spot for it to be effective.

    More concretely, consider the policy $\pi_{\text{eval}}(s) = \argmax_{a'} \pi^*_{\sft}(a'|s)$ that would be followed at test time with the maximum entropy objective. In the following, the maximum entropy objective will be said to be \textit{misalligned} with the standard objective when $\pi_{\text{eval}}(s) \neq \pi^*(s)$.

    Building off this intuition, in Section \todo{ref}, an MDP is constructed such that the temperature parameter needs to be made prohibitively small (i.e. little to no benefit is gained from the entropy rewards) to avoid the maximum entropy objective from being missaligned.

    While only MENTS has been discussed, the issue lies predominantly from mixing entropy into the scalar objective, and as such similar issues arise no matter the form of entropy considered. \todo{basically saying RENTS and TENTS dont fix this problem}





    Now \textit{simple regret} is defined, which will be used motivate and analyse the algorithms developed. The simple regret of a policy is the difference between the value of the policy and optimal value of the policy (\todo{ref the equation below}). By definition, the optimal policy achieves a simple regret of zero, and an MCTS algorithm is considered \textit{consistent} if it's expected simple regret tends to zero. In plain english, an algorithm is consistent if left to run forever it would eventually output an optimal policy. An implication of consistency is that if an algorithm can be run for longer, then it is expected to improve on its solution.

    \todo{Talk about the setup we're using. Probably want to try motive similarly to DENTS paper, and recall the diagram from} \ref{sec:2-3-rl}. \todo{Say that in fig below that normally step 3 is not considered}

                    \item the agent produces a recommendation policy $\psi^m$;
                    \item if the environment sends a stop signal, then the game ends, otherwise the next round starts.
                \end{enumerate}

        \label{fig:3:planning_problem}
    \end{figure}

    \todo{make this a proper def}
    Simple regret of a policy $\psi$ is then defined as
    \begin{align}
        \sreg(s,\psi) = V^*(s)-V^{\psi}(s).
    \end{align}

    \todo{make this a proper def}
    An agent, that produces recommendation policies $\psi^1,\psi^2,...$ is said to be \textit{consistent} if $\bb{E}[\sreg(s,\psi^m)] \rightarrow 0$ as $m\rightarrow \infty$.

    Returning to the discussion around UCT and MENTS now that simple regret and consistency has been defined. It can be shown the UCT is always consistent \todo{ref?}, although MDPs can be constructed where it requires a hyperexpontial amount of time to find the optimal policy. Whereas, the consistancy of MENTS depends on if the temperature parameter is sufficiently small for the optimal soft policy to not be misaligned with the standard optimal policy. Moreover, the threshold for the temperature parameter is dependent on the MDP, and so needs to be tuned on every MDP instance seperately.
    




    From the discussion in this section, the following properties are desired from the MCTS algorithms:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item define algorithms that are as simple to implement as UCT and MENTS;
        \item able to utilise dense and informative rewards (UCT \tick, MENTS \tick);
        \item effectively explore when rewards are sparse, or have sparse components (UCT \cross, MENTS \tick);
        \item are consistent, for parameters independent of the environment (UCT \tick, MENTS \cross). \todo{something like can get a reasonable result without haveing to tune params on each env. Maybe ``doesnt require parameter tuning on every environment''}
    \end{itemize}

    As such, this chapter will consider how entropy can be used as an additional secondary objective, while still focusing on performing well in the standard objective. \todo{place this better. Want it to say, that because the issue lies in the maximum entropy objective, we're going to start by stipping MENTS of the maximum entropy objective and then consider how it can be reintroduced in a consistent way.}

        \todo{Define with variable alpha, change proofs to say for fixed alpha get regret bound. And add theorem that }


        Our first approach, put simply, replaces the use of soft values in MENTS with 
        % \textit{dynamic programming} (DP) 
        \textit{Bellman} 
        values. We call this algorithm \textit{Boltzmann Tree Search} (BTS).  The search policy $\pi_{\textnormal{BTS}}$ and backups for the $n$th trial are given by:
        %


        This section introduces the \textit{Boltzmann Tree Search} (BTS) algorithm, presented in terms of the \thtspp\ewe schema \todo{ref}. BTS promotes exploration through the stochastic Boltzmann search policy, like MENTS \todo{ref}, while using backups that optimise for the standard objective, like UCT \todo{ref}. Unlike MENTS, the temperature parameter generalised to a function $\alphabts(x) > 0$, which allows the temperature to vary with the number of times that a node has visited. BTS uses Bellman value estimates at each node $\Vbts$ and $\Qbts$. The search policy is defined by:
        %
        \begin{align}
            \pibts(a|s) &= (1-\lambdabts)\rhobts(a|s) + \frac{\lambdabts}{|\cl{A}|}, 
                        \label{eq:4:bts_search_policy} \\ 
            \rhobts(a|s) &\propto \exp\left(\frac{1}{\alphabts(N(s))}\left(\Qbts(s,a)\right)\right).
                        \label{eq:4:bts_value_policy} \\
            \lambda(s,x) &= \min\left(1, \frac{x}{\log(e+N(s))}\right) \label{eq:4:lambda}
        \end{align}
        %
        where $\epsbts \in (0,\infty)$ is an exploration parameter and $\alphabts(x)$ is the search temperature schedule. \todo{Add a comment about defining rho as taking the max when N(s) is zero?} And given a trajectory $\tau=(s_0,a_0,r_0,...,s_{h-1},a_{h-1},r_{h-1},s_h)$ the value estimates are updated for $t=h-1,...,0$:
        \begin{align}
            \Qbts(s_t,a_t) &\leftarrow 
                R(s_t,a_t) + \sum_{s' \in \suc{s_t}{a_t}} \left( \frac{N(s')}{N(s_t,a_t)} \Vbts(s') \right), 
                        \label{eq:4:bts_backup_q} \\ 
            \Vbts(s_t) &\leftarrow \max_{a\in\cl{A}} \Qbts(s_t,a).
                        \label{eq:4:bts_backup_v} 
        \end{align}
        
        In line with the \thtspp\ewe schema, the values of $\hat{V}_{\bts}(s)$ and $\hat{Q}_{\bts}(s,a)$ are initialised using the arbitrary functions $\Vinit$ and $\Qinit$, which for example can be set to a constant value or be the output from a neural network. \todo{check all of the above definition is in line with thtspp definition} 
        
        
        When BTS needs to recommend a policy, it can use it's Q-value estimates:
        %
        \begin{align}
            \psibts(s)=\argmax_{a\in\cl{A}}\Qbts(s,a).
        \end{align}
        %
        Alternatively, the node visit counts can be used in the recommendation policy
        \begin{align}
            \texttt{mv}_{\bts}(s) = \argmax_{a\in\cl{A}} N(s,a).
        \end{align}
        %
        \todo{Find better notation for this?}

        As BTS uses Bellman backups, it can be guaranteed that the BTS recommendation policy converges to the optimal standard policy. \todo{make this sound better given we're also talking about most visited recommendation policy now.}
        








        \todo{Work out how best to add the AR-BTS stuff?}

        Additionally, this search policy can still be used with average returns. The following is a summary of the definitions for \textit{Boltzmann Tree Search with Average Returns} (AR-BTS), which uses the value estimates of $\Varbts$ and $\Qarbts$ at each node, and temperature schedule $\alphaarbts(x) > 0$:
        %
        \begin{align}
            \piarbts(a|s) &= (1-\lambdaarbts)\rhoarbts(a|s) + \frac{\lambdaarbts}{|\cl{A}|}, 
                        \label{eq:arbts_search_policy} \\ 
            \rhobts(a|s) &\propto \exp\left(\frac{1}{\alphaarbts(N(s))}\left(\Qarbts(s,a)\right)\right).
                        \label{eq:arbts_value_policy}
        \end{align}
        %
        where $\epsarbts \in (0,\infty)$ is an exploration parameter and $\alphaarbts(x)$ is the search temperature schedule. Given a trajectory $\tau=(s_0,a_0,r_0,...,s_{h-1},a_{h-1},r_{h-1},s_h)$ and the leaf node value estimate $\tilde{r} = \Vinit(s_h)$, the value estimates are updated for $t=h-1,...,0$:
        \begin{align}
            \Qarbts(s_t,a_t) &\leftarrow 
                \frac{1}{N(s_t,a_t)} \left( (N(s_t,a_t)-1) \Qarbts(s_t,a_t) 
                    + \tilde{r} + \sum_{i=t}^{h-1} r_i \right) \label{eq:4:arbsts_backup_q} \\
            \Varbts(s_t) &\leftarrow 
                \frac{1}{N(s_t)} \left( (N(s_t)-1) \Varbts(s_t) 
                    + \tilde{r} + \sum_{i=t}^{h-1} r_i \right). \label{eq:4:arbsts_backup_v} 
        \end{align}

        Similarly to BTS, either the Q-value estimates can be used for a recommendation policy or the most visited child node can be used:
        \begin{align}
            \psiarbts(s) &= \argmax_{a\in\cl{A}}\Qbts(s,a), \\
            \texttt{mv}_{\arbts}(s) &= \argmax_{a\in\cl{A}} N(s,a).
        \end{align}
        %
        \todo{Still find better notation for this?}








        In Section \todo{ref} convergence results about BTS and AR-BTS are given, which are summarised below:
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item BTS is consistent and converges for any setting of parameters;
            \item if $\alphabts(x) \geq L > 0$: BTS converges with an theoretical exponential rate;

    \subsection{Decaying ENtropy Tree Search}
    \label{sec:4-2-2-dents}

        \todo{add label}
        \todo{define DENTS in thtspp}

        \textit{Decaying ENtropy Tree Search} (DENTS) extends the BTS algorithm by introducing \textit{entropy estimates}. In DENTS nodes have a secondary entropy value estimate, $\HVdents$ and $\HQdents$, which are monte carlo estimates the entropy of the search policy rooted from the relevant node. By keeping a separate estimate for entropy, DENTS is able to use entropy in it's search policy, and discard it for recommendations.

        Given a trajectory $\tau=(s_0,a_0,r_0,...,s_{h-1},a_{h-1},r_{h-1},s_h)$, the entropy values are updated as follows for $t=h-1,...,0$:
        \begin{align}
            \HVdents(s_t) &\leftarrow \cl{H}(\pidents(\cdot | s_t)) + \sum_{a\in\cl{A}} \pidents(a|s_t)\HQdents(s_t,a), 
            \label{eq:4:dents_entropy_v_backup} \\
            \HQdents(s_t,a_t) &\leftarrow \sum_{s'\in \suc{s_t}{a_t}} \frac{N(s')}{N(s_t,a_t)} \HVdents(s'), 
            \label{eq::4dents_entropy_q_backup}
        \end{align}
        %
        where $\cl{H}$ is the Shannon entropy function. \todo{sentence about how the entropy values are initialised} $\HVdents(s) \leftarrow 0$.

        The entropy values are used as an exploration bonus in the search policy, and are weighted by a non-negative function $\betadents(x)\geq 0$. Generally this will be set to a function such that $\betadents(x)\rightarrow 0$ as $x\rightarrow\infty$ and will achieve better theoretical performance in this case. The DENTS search policy $\pidents$ is defined follows:
        %
        \begin{align}
            \pidents(a|s) &= (1-\lambdadents)\rhodents(a|s) + \frac{\lambdadents}{|\cl{A}|}, 
                        \label{eq:dents_search_policy} \\ 
            \rhodents(a|s) &\propto \exp\left(\frac{1}{\alphadents(N(s))}\left(\Qdents(s,a)+\beta(N(s))\HQdents(s,a)\right)\right).
                        \label{eq:dents_value_policy}
        \end{align}

        And finally, given the the trajectory $\tau$ the Bellman value estimates for DENTS, $\Vdents$ and $\Qdents$ are updated identically to BTS for $t=h-1,...,0$:
        \begin{align}
            \Qdents(s_t,a_t) &\leftarrow 
                R(s_t,a_t) + \sum_{s' \in \suc{s_t}{a_t}} \left( \frac{N(s')}{N(s_t,a_t)} \Vbts(s) \right), 
                        \label{eq:dents_q_backup} \\ 
            \Vdents(s_t) &\leftarrow \max_{a\in\cl{A}} \Qbts(s_t,a), 
                        \label{eq:dents_v_backup} 
        \end{align}

        Section \todo{ref} also provides convergence results about DENTS and AR-DENTS are given, which are summarised below:

    \subsection{Advantages of Stochastic Search Policies}
    \label{sec:4-2-3-stoch_search_policies}

        Using a stochastic search policy in MCTS (or \thtspp) provides more benefits than just encouraging exploration through randomly sampled actions. In particular, the Alias Method (Section \ref{sec:2-6-sampling}) can be used to trade off using the most up to date policy for computational speed. Moreover, when prior knowledge (in the form of a policy prior) is available \todo{cite alphago etc}, it can naturally be integrated into the search using a \textit{mixture policy}.

        \subsubsection{The Alias Method in MCTS}

        When using the Alias Method in \thtspp\ewe an alias table \todo{capitalise?} is constructed at every decision node. This table can be updated every $\lambda|\cl{A}|$ visits to the node, for an arbitrary $\lambda\in\bb{R}_{>0}$, giving an amortised complexity of $O(1)$. \todo{just say constant amortised complexity?} $O(O(1)+\frac{|\cl{A}}{\lambda|\cl{A}|}) = O(O(1)+\frac{1}{\lambda}) = O(1)$. \todo{probably dont need to do that maths.} In \thtspp the value of the $\lambda$ can be varied to adjust the trade off between The value of lambda can be varied to adjust the trade off between up-to-dateness and sampling speed. For the remainder \todo{find a better way of saying this}, $\lambda=1$ will be considered \todo{but all of the results still hold}. Note that when a new decision node is constructed and added to the tree, there will still be a cost of $O(|\cl{A}|)$ to construct the new alias table.
        
        Although this will always lead to quite a significant computational speedup, in the case where \mctsmode, the computational speedup is also asymptotic. \todo{where this paragraph go?}

        In the following, the computational complexity to run $n$ trials is considered.
        
        First consider the computational complexity of running UCT: at each decision node visited on a trial, the maximum over $|\cl{A}|$ values is computed \todo{this is worded poorly}, on each trial at most $H_{\thtspp}$ decision nodes will be visited. Hence, the computational complexity of running $n$ trials of UCT is $O(nH_{\thtspp}|\cl{A}|)$.

        \todo{copy out appendix C stuff, cleaning up above and below as needed}

        Finally, considering the case when \thtspp\ewe is not running in \mctsmode, the asymptotic complexity is still $O(nH_{\thtspp}|\cl{A}|)$, as each trial is sampled until the planning horizon $H_{\thtspp}$

        \subsubsection{Encorporating Prior Knowledge Through Mixture Policies}

        Let $\pi$ be some \thtspp\ewe search policy, and supposed that we have access to another policy $\tilde{\pi}$ with prior knowledge, such as a neural network. Then a new search policy $\pi_{\text{mix}}$ can be naturally be defined using a mixture of $\pi$ and $\tilde{\pi}$.

        \todo{some comment about just using the same mixing function as before ... because? .. it lets it tend towards the correct thing}

        The mixture policy is defined by:
        \begin{align}
            \pi_{\text{mix}}(a|s) = 
                (1-\lambda(s,\epsilon_{\text{mix}})) \pi(a|s) 
                + \lambda(s,\epsilon_{\text{mix}}) \tilde{\pi}(a|s),
        \end{align}

        where $\lambda$ is the same function as defined in equation (\todo{ref}), and $\epsilon_{\text{mix}}\in(0,\infty)$ weights the amount to use the prior knowledge by. \todo{word better}.

        \todo{are there theoretical results? Maybe we can show that for arbitrary function that it doesnt change anything. It should be the same as mixing in the uniform. Also another good reason to use the same function, because then the proof is basically the same thing as before.}

\section{Toy Environments}
\label{sec:4-3-toyenvs}

    \todo{list}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Define D-chain stuff from the paper
        \item Define the D-chain with entropy trap
        \item Front load some results still
    \end{itemize}

    \todo{(commented out below this), original writing in the motivation section, which talked about the d-chain environment.}

    % In the maximum entropy objective, it is argued that the standard objective can be recovered by setting $\alpha=0$ or setting $\alpha$ infitesimally small ($0<\alpha<<1$). \todo{add quote}. 
    % %
    % \todo{Although this is theoretically true (TODO ref the result about MENTS), in practise it is desirable to use the largest temperature that doesn't lead to undesirable (random) behaviour. In other words, extermely small temperatures do not utilise entropy for exploration effectively, while extremely large temperatures encourage agents to act randomly rather (reword: optimise for the standard objective). MENTS is used in (TODO) to demonstrate this issue with the maximum-entropy objective empirically, and (TODO) provides a corresponding theoretical result around MENTS.}
    % %
    % Although this is true, the most benefit can be gained from using entropy as an exploration bonus by setting a larger value of $\alpha$. This is highlighted in Figure \todo{ref}, where the performance on MENTS on the modified D-chain environment can be seen to improve as $\alpha$ is made larger, until a sudden drop off when it surpasses a threshold (\todo{at the poing 0.142ish}).
     
    % Above the threshold, an agent can gain more ``reward'' by acting randomly and optimising for maximum-entropy, largely ignoring the rewards of the MDP. This example demonstrates an issue with using the maximum-entropy objective, where the temperature parameter needs to be finely tuned to a sweet-spot for it to be effective.

    % This issue can be exasurbated further by editing the D-chain environment to contain an entropy trap. In the entropy trap environment \todo{ref fig}, an additional trap for maximum-entropy agents is added to the D-chain environment. In this environment, when the end of the chain is reached, there are two choices, to either collect the immediate reward of $1$, or to follow another path where high entropy can be obtained, but no reward can be obtained. The maximum entropy that can be obtained from following the chain is $\alpha K \log(2)$, and as such will mislead any maximum-entropy agents that have a temperature parameter of $\alpha > \frac{1}{k\log(2)}$. Setting \todo{k=what}, sets this threshold at \todo{todo say $\alpha > C$ for now}. However, for $\alpha \leq C$, the temperature parameter is low enough that not much benefit is gained from the entropy objective.

    % Figure \todo{ref} shows the performance of ments on the entropy trap environment, highlighting that it doesn't perform well for any setting of $\alpha$. In contrast, the algorithms defined in this chapter are able to overcome these issues.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item DChain
        \item GridWorlds
        \item Go
    \end{itemize}

    - Get some better results using hyperparam optimise
    - want a dense env where the (not entropy) temp decay fn gets optimised to soemthing that decays a lot
    - want a sparse env where the temp decay fn gets optimised to something flat (or basically flat)

    \todo{ TWO: would like to have experiments which vary the proportion of the sparse reward. So have FL(lambda), where lambda specifies the ratio between the dense and sparse rewards. Then investigate what happens as vary lambda. So this is the grid world experiments run again, }

\section{Theoretical Results}
\label{sec:4-5-theory}

    \todo{list}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item add theoretical results
    \end{itemize}

    Should we try to add a result about most visited? Where will be concentration bounds around the number of visits being proportional to the values. So think can bootstrap those proofs.

    - Generalise the AR proof to say that for decaying search functions still work (as long as they are bounded)
    - Have a result that using most visited is theoretically sound
