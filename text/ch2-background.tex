\section{Markov Decision Processes}
\label{sec:2-1-mdps}

    \hide{\todo{chatgpt the intro stuff}}

    In this section \textit{Markov Decision Processes} (MDPs) are introduced, along with related defintions of \textit{policies} and \textit{trajectories}. MDPs give a mathematical framework for problems concerning sequential decision making under uncertainty, and in this thesis will be the framework used to model the environment that agents act in. An MDP contains, among other things, a set of states and actions. States are sampled according to a transition distribution which depends on the current state and current action being taken (the Markov assumption). Any time an action is taken from a state the agent recieves an instantaneous reward, according to a reward function that depends on the state and action taken.

    This thesis is concerned with discrete, finite, fully-observable and finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes, meaning that the state and action spaces are discrete and finite, and any \textit{trajectories} (sequences of states, actions and rewards) are of a finite length. \todo{at points we may allude to some designs and ideas that can generalise to more general forms of markov decision processes, but it is not the main focus here.}

    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:mdp}
        A \textnormal{Markov Decision Process} (MDP) is a tuple $\cl{M}=(\cl{S},s_0,\cl{A},R,p,H)$, where $\cl{S}$ is a set of states, $s_0\in\cl{S}$ is an initial state, $\cl{A}$ is a set of actions, $R(s,a)$ is a reward function $\cl{S}\times \cl{A}\rightarrow \bb{R}$, $p(s' | s,a)$ is a next state transition distribution $\cl{S} \times \cl{A} \times \cl{S} \rightarrow [0,1]$ and $H\in\bb{N}$ is a finite-horizon time bound. 
    \end{defn}

    \begin{figure}
        \centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/ch2/example_mdp.pdf} 
        \caption[An example MDP $\cl{M}$.]{An example MDP $\cl{M}$, where \todo{description of MDP drawn}}
        \label{fig:mdp_eg}
    \end{figure}

    An example MDP is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mdp_eg}. Notationally, it is convenient to define the set of successor states, that is the set of states that could be reached after taking an action from the current state of the MDP:
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:succ}
        The set of \textnormal{successor states} $\suc{s}{a}$ of a state-action pair $(s,a)$, with respect to an MDP, is defined as: 
        \begin{align}
            \suc{s}{a}:=\{s'\in\cl{S}|p(s'|s,a)>0\}. \label{eq:succ_def}
        \end{align}
        
        Additionally, let $s'\sim \suc{s}{a}$ be a shorthand for $s'\sim p(\cdot|s,a)$.
    \end{defn}

    To define a strategy that an agent will follow in an MDP, and agent defines a \textit{policy}. A policy maps each state in the state space to a probability distribution over the action space. To ``follow'' a policy, actions are sampled from the distribution. Often it is desirable to define deterministic policies, which always produce the same action when given the same state, and can be represented as \textit{one-hot} distributions. 

    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:policy}
        A \textnormal{(stochastic) policy} $\pi:\cl{S}\rightarrow (\cl{A} \rightarrow [0,1])$ is a mapping from states to a probability distributions over actions and $\pi(a|s)$ is the probability of sampling action $a$ at state $s$. The policy $\pi$ must satisfy the conditions: for all $s \in \cl{S}$ we have $\sum_{a\in\cl{A}} \pi(a|s) = 1$ and for all $a\in\cl{A}. \pi(a|s)\geq 0$ . 
        
        Additionally, a \textnormal{deterministic policy} is defined as a one-hot policy, that is, the policy $\pi$ is deterministic iff it can be written as $\pi(a|s)=\one[a=a']$ for some $a'\in\cl{A}$.

        Moreover, the following notations are used for policies:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $a\sim\pi(\cdot|s)$ denotes sampling an action $a$ from the distribution $\pi(\cdot|s)$;
            \item $\pi(s)=a'$ is used as a shorthand to define the deterministic policy $\pi(a|s)=\one[a=a']$; 
            \item $\pi(s)$ is used as a shorthand for the action $a'\sim\pi(\cdot|s)$ in the case of a deterministic policy.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{defn}
    
    Given an MDP $\cl{M}$ and a policy $\pi$ it is then possible to sample a sequence of states, actions and rewards, known as a \textit{trajectory}. A trajectory \textit{simulates} one possible sequence that could occur if an agent follows policy $\pi$ in $\cl{M}$, and in Section \todo{ref} these simulations are used to incrementally build a search tree.
    
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:trajectory}
        A \textnormal{trajectory} $\tau$, is a sequence of state, action and rewards, that is induced by a policy $\pi$ and MDP $\cl{M}$ pair. Let the trajectory be $\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_0, s_1, a_1, r_1, ..., s_{H-1}, a_{H-1}, r_{H-1}, s_H)$, where $a_t \sim \pi(\cdot|s_t)$, $r_t=R(s_t,a_t)$ and $s_{t+1} \sim \suc{s_t}{a_t}$. 
        
        The following notations will also be used for trajectories:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\tau\sim\pi$ denotes a trajectory that is sampled using the policy $\pi$, where the MDP $\cl{M}$ is implicit;
            \item $\tau_{i:j}$ denotes the \textnormal{truncated trajectory} $\tau_{i:j}:=(s_i, a_i, r_i, s_{i+1}, ..., s_{j-1}, a_{j-1}, r_{j-1}, s_j)$, between the timesteps $0\leq i < j \leq H$ inclusive;
            \item $\tau_{:j}:=\tau_{0:j}$ denotes a trajectory that is trunacted on only one end,
            \item finally, given a trajectory $\tau$, the following set notation is used, $s\in \tau$, $(s,a)\in\tau$ as a shorthand for $s\in\{s_i|i=0,...,H\}$ and $(s,a)\in\{(s_i,a_i)|i=0,...,H-1\}$ respectively. 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{defn}

        \label{fig:rl_overview}
    \end{figure}

    \hide{\todo{chatgpt the intro stuff}}

    This section serves as a brief introduction to fundamental concepts in Reinforcement Learning, and motivates . The field of Reinforcement Learning considers an agent that has to learn how to make decisions by interacting with its environment (Figure \ref{fig:rl_overview}). The agent can take actions in the environment, recieving in return \textit{observations} and \textit{rewards}, which can be used to update internal state and used to make further decisions, and the goal of the agent is to maximise the rewards that it recieves.

    Classically the agent is considered to interact with its environment directly \todo{cite sutton and barto?}, and thus must make a trade-off between exploring new strategies and exploiting learned strategies, commonly known as the \textit{exploration-exploitation trade-off}. If an agent were to try to only exploit, then it may not discover better strategies, and if an agent only explores, then it may miss out on the opportunity to exploit the best known strategy and obtain greater rewards.

    Also depicted in Figure \ref{fig:rl_overview} is a scenario where the agent is equiped with a simulator that it can use to plan and explore, and is either asked to recommend a strategy after a planning/learning phase, or is occassionally queried to recommend actions. This scenario more closely resembles how reinforcement learning is used in the modern era with greater amounts of compute power available, and interactions with the simulator occur at orders of magnitude quicker. Hence, in this scenario, the only significant real-world cost comes from following the recommendations output, to be used in the real-world environment. This changes the nature of the exploration-exploitation trade off, almost separating the two issues, where there is an emphasis on exploring during the planning phase, and the problem of providing good recommendations is concerned with pure exploitation. 

    In this thesis, the environment will always take the form of an MDP (Defintion \ref{def:mdp}), and observations will always be \textit{fully-observable}, meaning that the agent is provided with full access to the states of the MDP. \todo{comment about partially observable? and cite?}. Moreover, a lot of the work in this thesis concerns the simulation scenario from Figure \ref{fig:rl_overview}, and motivates our research questions around exploration: \exploreq.

    Following on from Section \ref{sec:2-1-mdps}, the remainder of this section defines \textit{value functions} and the objectives of reinforcement learning, covers \textit{Value Iteration}, a tabular dynamic programming approach to reinforcement learning, and finally Subsection \ref{sec:2-2-1-merl} covers \textit{Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning}.
    
    The value of a policy $\pi$ is the expected cumulative reward that will be obtained by following the policy:
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:value}
        \label{def:q_value}
        The \textnormal{value} of a policy $\pi$ from state $s$ at time $t$ is:
        \begin{align}
            V^{\pi}(s;t) = \bb{E}_{\tau\sim\pi}\left[\sum_{i=t}^{H-1} r_t \Bigg| s_t=s \right]. \label{eq:value_fn_def}
        \end{align} 

        The \textnormal{Q-value} of a policy $\pi$, from state $s$, with action $a$, at time $t$ is:
        \begin{align}
            Q^{\pi}(s,a;t) = R(s,a) + \bb{E}_{s'\sim \suc{s}{a}} [V^{\pi}(s';t+1)]. \label{eq:q_value_fn_def}
        \end{align} 
    \end{defn}

    From the definition of the values functions the optimal value functions can be defined by taking the maximum value over all policies:
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:optimal_value}
        \label{def:optimal_q_value}
        The \textnormal{Optimal (Q-)Value} of a state(-action pair) is defined as:
        \begin{align}
            V^*(s;t) &= \max_{\pi} V^{\pi}(s;t) \label{eq:opt_value_fn_def} \\
            Q^*(s,a;t) &= \max_{\pi} Q^{\pi}(s,a;t). \label{eq:opt_q_value_fn_def}
        \end{align}
    \end{defn}

    Value functions can also be used to define an objective function:
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:rl_obj_fn}
        The \textnormal{(standard) reinforcement learning objective function} $J(\pi)$ is defined as:
        \begin{align}
            J(\pi) = V^{\pi}(s_0;0). \label{eq:rl_obj_fn_def}
        \end{align}

        The objective of (standard) reinforcement learning can then be stated as finding $\max_{\pi} J(\pi)$.
    \end{defn}

    The \textit{optimal policy} is the policy that maximises the objective function $J$, can be shown to be deterministic \todo{under conditions, finite?} \todo{cite}:
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:opt_policy}
        The \textnormal{optimal (standard) policy} $\pi^*$ is the policy maximising the standard objective function:
        \begin{align}
            \pi^* = \argmax_\pi J(\pi) \label{eq:opt_policy_def}
        \end{align}
        or equivalently, the optimal standard policy can be found from the optimal Q-value function:
        \begin{align}
            \pi^*(s) = \argmax_a Q^*(s,a). \label{eq:opt_policy_from_opt_q_value}
        \end{align}
    \end{defn}

    \todo{all refs below I think can be Sutton and Barto, or [Bellman 1957] Bellman, R. 1957. Dynamic Programming. Princeton, NJ, USA: Princeton University Press, 1 edition.}

    It can be shown that the optimal (Q-)value functions satisfy the \textit{Bellman equations} \todo{refs} :
    \begin{align}
        V^*(s;t) &= \max_{a\in\cl{A}} Q^*(s,a;t), \label{eq:bellman_opt_v} \\
        Q^*(s,a;t) &= R(s,a) + \bb{E}_{s'\sim \suc{s}{a}} [V^*(s';t+1)]. \label{eq:bellman_opt_q}
    \end{align} 

    The Bellman equations admit a \textit{dynamic programming} approach which can be used to computer the optimal value functions, known as \textit{Value Iteration} \todo{ref}. In Value iteration, a table of value estimates $\hat{V}(s;t)$ are kept for each $s,t$. Given any initial estimate of the value function $\hat{V}^{0}$, the \textit{Bellman backup} operations are:
    \begin{align}
        \hat{V}^{k+1}(s;t) &= \max_{a\in\cl{A}} \hat{Q}^{k+1}(s,a;t), \label{eq:value_iter_v_backup} \\
        \hat{Q}^{k+1}(s,a;t) &= \bb{E}_{s'\sim \suc{s}{a}} [R(s,a) + \hat{V}^k(s';t+1)]. \label{eq:value_iter_q_backup}
    \end{align}

    In each iteration of Value Iteration, these values are computed for all $s\in\cl{S}$, $a\in\cl{A}$ and $t\in\{0,1,...,H\}$. The Bellman equations can be shown to be \textit{contraction operators} \todo{refs}, which can be used to show that $V^{k}\rightarrow V^*$ as $k\rightarrow \infty$, and when the state and action spaces are discrete, they will converge in a finite number of iterations. \todo{refs}





    \subsection{Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning}
    \label{sec:2-2-1-merl}

        In \textit{Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning}, the objective function is altered to include the addition of an entropy term. The addition of an entropy term is motivated by wanting to learn stochastic behaviours, that better explore large state spaces, and learn more robust behaviours under uncertainty by potentially learning multiple solutions rather than a single deterministic solution. \cite{deep_energy_policies}. 
        
        Let $\cl{H}$ denote the (Shannon) entropy function \cite{entropy}:
        \begin{align}
            \cl{H}(\pi(\cdot|s)) = \bb{E}_{a\sim\pi(\cdot|s)}[-\log \pi(a|s)] = \sum_{a\in\cl{A}} \pi(a|s) \log \pi(a|s). \label{eq:shannon_entropy_def}
        \end{align}

        In the maximum entropy objective, the relative weighting of entropy terms is included using a coefficient $\alpha$, called the \textit{temperature}. In the maximum entropy objective, analogues of the value functions can be defined, which are typically referred to as \textit{soft (Q-)values}, and similarly the maximum entropy objective is often referred to as the \textit{soft objective}.

        Soft values are defined as follows:
        \begin{defn}
            \label{def:sft_value}
            \label{def:sft_q_value}
            The \textnormal{soft value} of a policy $\pi$ from state $s$ at time $t$ is:
            \begin{align}
                V_{\sft}^{\pi}(s;t) = \bb{E}_{\tau\sim\pi}\left[\sum_{i=t}^{H-1} r_t + \alpha\cl{H}(\pi(\cdot|s_i)) \Bigg| s_t=s \right]. \label{eq:sft_value_fn_def}
            \end{align} 

            The \textnormal{soft Q-value} of a policy $\pi$, from state $s$, with action $a$, at time $t$ is:
            \begin{align}
                Q_{\sft}^{\pi}(s,a;t) = R(s,a) + \bb{E}_{s'\sim p(\cdot|s,a)} [V_{\sft}^{\pi}(s';t+1)]. \label{eq:sft_q_value_fn_def}
            \end{align} 
        \end{defn}

        Similarly, optimal soft (Q-)values can be defined by taking the maximum over policies again:
        \begin{defn}
            \label{def:optimal_sft_value}
            \label{def:optimal_sft_q_value}
            The \textnormal{Optimal soft (Q-)Value} of a state(-action pair) is defined as:
            \begin{align}
                V_{\sft}^*(s;t) &= \max_{\pi} V_{\sft}^{\pi}(s;t), \label{eq:opt_soft_value_fn_def} \\
                Q_{\sft}^*(s,a;t) &= \max_{\pi} Q_{\sft}^{\pi}(s,a;t). \label{eq:opt_soft_q_value_fn_def}
            \end{align}
        \end{defn}

        In maximum entropy reinforcement learning, the objective is to find a policy with maximal soft value:
        \begin{defn}
            \label{def:soft_rl_obj_fn}
            The \textnormal{maximum entropy (or soft) reinforcement learning objective function} $J_{\sft}(\pi)$ is defined as:
            \begin{align}
                J_{\sft}(\pi) = V_{\sft}^{\pi}(s_0;0). \label{eq:soft_rl_obj_fn_def}
            \end{align}

            The objective of maximum entropy (or soft) reinforcement learning can then be stated as finding $\max_{\pi} J_{\sft}(\pi)$.
        \end{defn}

        The optimal soft policy is defined as the policy that maximises the soft objective function $J_{\sft}$, and with knowledge of the optimal soft value and soft Q-value functions, the optimal soft policy is known:
        \begin{defn}
            \label{def:opt_sft_policy}
            The \textnormal{optimal soft policy} $\pi_{\sft}^*$ is the policy maximising the soft objective function:
            \begin{align}
                \pi_{\sft}^* = \argmax_\pi J_{\sft}(\pi). \label{eq:opt_sft_policy_def}
            \end{align}
            Given $V_{\sft}^*$ and $Q_{\sft}^*$ the optimal soft police is known to take the form \cite{deep_energy_policies}:
            \begin{align}
                \pi_{\sft}^*(a|s;t) = \exp\left(\left(Q_{\sft}^*(s,a;t) - V_{\sft}^*(s;t)\right) / \alpha \right). \label{eq:opt_sft_policy_from_opt_value_fns}
            \end{align}
        \end{defn}

        Equations similar to the Bellman equations, aptly named the \textit{Soft Bellman equations}, can be defined for maximum entropy reinforcement learning \cite{deep_energy_policies}. These equations differ to equations (\ref{eq:bellman_opt_v}) and (\ref{eq:bellman_opt_q}) by the replacement of the $\max$ operation with a \textit{softmax} or \textit{log-sum-exp} operation, and explain why the maximum entropy analogues are referred to as the \textit{soft} versions of their standard reinforcement learning counterparts.

        Similarly to standard reinforcement learning, it can be shown that the optimal soft (Q-)value functions satisfy the \textit{soft Bellman equations} \cite{deep_energy_policies}:
        \begin{align}
            V_{\sft}^*(s;t) &= \alpha \log \sum_{a\in\cl{A}} \exp\left( Q_{\sft}^*(s,a;t) / alpha \right), \label{eq:sft_bellman_opt_v} \\
            Q_{\sft}^*(s,a;t) &= R(s,a) + \bb{E}_{s'\sim \suc{s}{a}} [V_{\sft}^*(s';t+1)]. \label{eq:sft_bellman_opt_q}
        \end{align} 

        Again, similarly to standard reinforcement learning, \textit{soft Bellman backups} can be defined that admit an analogous algorithm \textit{Soft Value Iteration} \cite{deep_energy_policies}:
        \begin{align}
            \hat{V}_{\sft}^{k+1}(s;t) &= \alpha \log \sum_{a\in\cl{A}} \exp\left( \hat{Q}_{\sft}^{k+1}(s,a;t) / alpha \right), \\
            \hat{Q}_{\sft}^{k+1}(s,a;t) &= R(s,a) + \bb{E}_{s'\sim \suc{s}{a}} [\hat{V}_{\sft}^k(s';t+1)].
        \end{align}

    In the $K$-armed bandit problem, an agent is tasked with iteratively selecting one of $K$ arms, originally introduced by \todo{author} \todo{cite MAB orig}. In each iteration, once an arm is selected, say $x\in\{1,...,K\}$, and a reward $y$ is returned according to an unknown probability distribution $f_x$. Let $n$ be the number of rounds of this game that are played, and let $\mu_i=\bb{E}[y|x=i]$ be the expected reward of pulling arm $i$. 
    
    When analysing an algorithmic strategy for Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs), a quantity known as \textit{regret} is commonly used, which compares the cumulative reward obtained, compared to the maximal reward that could be obtained with full knowledge of $\{f_i\}$.

    \hide{\todo{work out how to deal with the issue of not having policies defined yet. thinhk this needs to be moved to after ch2.1}}

        \item agent recieves reward $y^m \sim f_{x^i}$

        where $\mu^* = max_i \mu_i$.
    \end{defn}

    To theoretically analyse algorithms for MAB problems, the quantity of expected regret, $\bb{E}[\creg_{\mab}]$ is considered. In \todo{cite} it is shown using information theory that there is a lower bound on the expected regret that an agent can achieve of $\Sigma(\log N)$, and in \todo{cite ucb} the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm is introduced, achieving a matching upper bound of $O(\log N)$. 

    Let $N^m(j)$ be the number of times that arm $i$ has been pulled after $m$ rounds, $\bar{y}_i^m$ is the sample average of rewards recieved when pulling arm $i$: 
    \begin{align}
        \bar{y}_i^m=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^m y^j \one[x^j=i].
    \end{align} 
    
    Then the arm selected by the UCB algorithm on the $m$th round is given by:
    \begin{align}
        \pi_{\ucb}(m) = \argmax_{j\in\{1,..,K\}} \bar{y}_j^m + b_{\ucb} \sqrt{\frac{\log(m)}{N(j)}} 
    \end{align}

    \subsection{Exploring Bandits}
    \label{sec:2-3-1-exploring-mab}

        In the pure exploration $K$-armed bandit problem \todo{cite},
        %https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04414-4_7#preview, 
        the game is changed slighly. The agent still gets to pull an arm each round, but after it recieves a reward each round it is given the opportunity to output a \textit{recommendation}. In exploring multi-armbed bandits (EMABs), the emphasis is now on the algorithm being able to provide the best recommendations possible, rather than trying to exploit pulling the best arm each round. In essence, this change seperates the needs to explore and exploit, the agent needs to explore with its arm pulls, and output an exploiting recommendation at the end of each round.

        \todo{some sentence}, the process of a EMAB is as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item for $m$ in $\{1,...,n\}$:
            \item agent selects arm $x^m$ according to policy $\pi^m$
            \item agent recieves reward $y^m \sim f_{x^m}$
            \item agent outputs a recommendation policy $\psi^m$
        \end{itemize}

        Under this regime, the performance of an algorithm can be analysed by considering the quantity of \textit{simple regret} of the recommendation policy. The simple regret is the expected value of an \textit{instantaneous regret}, \todo{define instantaneous regret} which would come from following the recommendation policy.

        \begin{defn}
            The \textnormal{simple regret} of following the recommendation policy $\psi^m$ on the $m$th round is:
            \begin{align}
                \sreg_{\emab}(m) = \bb{E}_{i\sim\psi^m}[\mu^* - \mu_i].
            \end{align}

    \subsection{Contextual Bandits}
    \label{sec:2-3-2-contextual-mab}

        \hide{\todo{sleepy and rushed this section a bit}}

        In the contextual $K$-armed bandit problem \todo{cite}, on each round the algorithm is given a context $w\in \cl{W}$, which the algorithm does not choose. If contextual multi-armed bandit problems (CMABs), the distribution that the rewards are drawn from now depend on $w$, written $f_{w,i}$ for context $w$ for arm $i$. 

        \todo{some more words around when this is useful and why, and define CMABs}

        \todo{some sentence}, the process of a CMAB is as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item for $m$ in $\{1,...,n\}$:
            \item agent recieves context $w^m$
            \item agent selects arm $x^m$ according to policy $\pi$
            \item agent recieves reward $y^m \sim f_{w^m,x^m}$
        \end{itemize}

        Similar to MABs and EMABs, the notion of regret is used to analyse CMABs. Specifically, \textit{contextual regret} is defined similarly to cumulative regret \todo{ref}, while taking into account the contexts drawn.

        \begin{defn}
            The \textnormal{(cumulative) contextual regret} of the agent in the above process is defined as:
            \begin{align}
                \ctxreg_{\cmab}(\pi,n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_{w^i}^* - y^i,
            \end{align}
            where $\mu_{w}^* = \max_i \mu_{w,i}$.

\section{Trial-Based Heuristic Tree Search and Monte Carlo Tree Search}
\label{sec:2-4-thts}

    \thtspp\ewe \cite{thtspp} is introduced in this section, which is an open-source, parallelised extension of the  Trial-based Heuristic Tree Search (THTS) schema \cite{thts}. \thtspp\ewe is a generalisation of what is commonly meant by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which is presented in Section \ref{sec:2-4-3-mcts} in terms of \thtspp. This thesis considers fully-observable environments, but \thtspp\ewe can be used to implement algorithms that consider \textit{partially-observable} environments, such as POMCP \todo{expand accronym, cite}. In Section \ref{sec:2-4-2-uct} the standard Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees (UCT) algorithm is presented in terms of \thtspp\ewe, and in Section \ref{sec:2-4-4-ments} the Maximum ENtropy Tree Search (MENTS) algorithm is presented.

    \todo{want a second para saying things like: mcts is used as a heuristic method to solve MDPs; useful for when state space is large enough that using a tabular method like value iteration is too slow; often used online, to interleve planning an executing; they allow for statistical analysis and are more interperable than deep learning methods; and they can still be used with deep learning methods in algorithms like alphazero}

    This thesis uses the term MCTS to refer to any algorithm that builds a search tree using \textit{Monte Carlo trials}, so any algorithm defined in terms of \thtspp\ewe is an MCTS algorithm. 




    \subsection{Notation}
    \label{sec:2-4-0-notation}
        To simplify notation in the presentation of \thtspp, when discussing tree search algorithms this thesisassume that states and state-action pairs have a one-to-one correspondance with nodes in the search tree. This assumption is purely to simplify notation for a clean presentation, and any results discussed in this thesis generalise to when this assumption does not hold. 

        Specifically, this allows the notation for value functions to avoid explicitly writing the timestep parameter, so that $V^{\pi}(s)$ can be written instead of $V^{\pi}(s;t)$.

                \item TODO: probably not necessary to say - but thought of nice/concise way of explaining it (a node can lock children, not parent, if need info from parent, then it has to put a thread safe copy in the context)

            \end{itemize}
        }

        In \thtspp\ewe trees consist of \textit{decision nodes} and \textit{chance nodes}. Decision nodes output actions that can be taken by the agent, and chance nodes output \textit{outcomes} that may be random and may depend on the action taken. As such, each decision node has an associated \textit{state} and each chance node has an associated \textit{state-action pair}. Figure \ref{fig:tree_notation} shows how decision and chance nodes will be depicted in diagrams.

        \begin{figure}
            \centering\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{figures/ch2/tree_notation.pdf} 
            \caption[Tree diagrams notation.]{Tree diagrams notation, circles will be used to denote \textit{decision nodes} that are associated with states, diamonds will be used to denote \textit{chance nodes} that are associated with state-action pairs and arrows are used to denote parent/child relationships in the tree.}
            \label{fig:tree_notation}
        \end{figure}

        A search tree $\cl{T}$ is built using Monte Carlo \textit{trials}. Each trial is split into two phases: the \textit{selection phase} where a trajectory is sampled using a \textit{search policy}, and any newly visited states (and state-action pairs) are added to $\cl{T}$ as decision nodes (and chance nodes); and the \textit{backup phase} where value estimates stored in the tree structure are updated. An overview of one trial in \thtspp\ewe is given in Figure \ref{fig:thts}.

        \begin{defn}
            \label{def:search_tree}
            A \textnormal{search tree} $\cl{T}$ is a subset of the state and state-action spaces, that is $\cl{T}\subseteq \cl{S} \cup \cl{S} \times \cl{A}$, where for each $s\in\cl{T}$, there exists some truncated trajectory $\tau_{:h}$ such that $s_h = s$, each $s'\in\tau_{:h}$ is also in the tree $s'\in\cl{T}$ and each $s',a'\in\tau{:h}$ is also in the tree $(s',a')\in\cl{T}$.
        \end{defn}

        % \begin{defn}
        %     \label{def:cnode}
        %     \label{def:dnode}
            A \textit{decision node} refers to any state that is in the search tree: $s\in\cl{T}$. A \textit{chance node} refers to any state-action pair that is in the search tree: $(s,a)\in\cl{T}$. And a \textit{node} is used to refer to any decision or chance node in the tree. Sometimes the notation $\node(s)$ and $\node(s,a)$ will be used to make it clear that a node is being discussed, rather than a state or state-action pair.

            $N(s)$ and $N(s,a)$ denote the number of times $\node(s)$ and $\node(s,a)$ have been visited, or the number of times $s$ and $(s,a)$ appear in trajectories sampled in \thtspp\ewe trials.

            Each decision and chance node will generally store value estimates that are algorithm dependent. $\dnodedata{s}$ is used to denote the set of values stored at node $\node(s)$, and $\cnodedata{s,a}$ for the set of value stored at node $\node(s,a)$. 

            Additionally, let $\node(s)\dotchildren$ be the set of chance nodes that are children of $\node(s)$, and likewise, $\node(s,a)\dotchildren$ is the set of decision nodes that are children of $\node(s,a)$.
        % \end{defn}

        \thtspp\ewe introduces the idea of \mctsmode\ewe into the THTS schema. When running in \mctsmode, the trajectory sampled in the selection phase is truncated, and ends when the first state not in the search tree $\cl{T}$ is reached. When not running in \mctsmode, the trajectory is sampled until the $H$, the finite horizon of the MDP. These two modes are depicted in blue (\mctsmode\ewe on) and orange (\mctsmode\ewe off) in Figure \ref{fig:thts}. 

        \thtspp\ewe also introduces the notion of a \textit{context} that is sampled for each trial. A context is an arbitrary key-value store that is used to store any relevant data that varies from trial to trial. The context is passed to every subsequent function call in a trial of \thtspp, and can be used to store temporary state. This context will go unused for the remainder of the chapter, but will be useful in Chapters \ref{ch:5-chmcts} and \ref{ch:6-simplexmaps} when \textit{contextual tree search} is discussed. Moreover, beyond the scope of this thesis, the notion of a context is necessary to encapsulate ideas such as the state sampled from a \textit{belief state} used in the POMCP algorithm for planning in partially observable environments \todo{cite}.

        To specify an algorithm in the \thtspp\ewe schema, the following need to be provided:
        \begin{description}
            \item[Search policy:]
                A policy $\pisearch$ used to sample a trajectory for the trial, which can use values in the current search tree $\cl{T}$, and values from the heuristic action function;
            \item[Heuristic value function:]
                A function $\Vinit$ used as a heuristic to initialise values for new decision nodes added to the tree;
            \item[Heuristic action function:]
                A function $\Qinit$ used as a heuristic for Q-values when a state-action pair is not in the current search tree ;
            \item[Backup functions:]
                Two functions $\backupv$ and $\backupq$ which updates the values in decision and chance nodes respectively. These functions can use values from their children, from the sampled trajectory and from the heuristic value function;
            \item[Context sampler:]
                A function $\samplecontext$ which creates a context key-value store, and samples any initial values to be stored in the context;
            \item[MCTS mode:]
                A boolean \mctsmode specifying if \thtspp\ewe should operate in MCTS mode.
        \end{description}

        At the beginning of runnning a \thtspp\ewe algorithm, the search tree is initialised to $\cl{T}=\{s_0\}$. When the components detailed above are provided, the operation of a trial in \thtspp\ewe is as follows. Firstly, a context is sampled using the $\samplecontext$ function, which is available to be used by any other function in the trial. A trajectory is sampled $\tau_{:h}\sim\pisearch$ according to the search policy, which may use $\Qinit$ as necessary. If running in \mctsmode, then $\tau_{:h}$ is such that $s_t\in\cl{T}$ for $t=0,...,h-1$ and $s_h\not\in\cl{T}$, or $h=H$. If not running in \mctsmode, then $h=H$. The search tree is updated to include any new nodes from the sampled trajectory, $\cl{T}\leftarrow\cl{T}\cup\tau_{:h}$. The heuristic value function is used to initialise the value of the new leaf node $\dnodedata{s_h}\leftarrow \Vinit(s_h)$. Finally, for the backup phase, the $\backupq$ and $\backupv$ functions are used to update the values of $\cnodedata{s_t,a_t}$ and $\dnodedata{s_t}$ for $t=h-1,...,0$. Figure \ref{fig:thts} depicts this process, and psuedocode is given in Listing \ref{lst:thts_trial}.

        \hide{\todo{Rushing through the todo's here so probably needs another round for 2nd pass, not doing any adding labels to defs and equations, not making any diagrams}}

        \hide{\todo{I'm feeling ill writing this section, so just going to word vomit this shit out and make it sound not shit later}}

        Upper Confidence Bounds Applied to Trees (UCT) \todo{cite both papers} is a commonly used tree search algorithm, which is based on the Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) \todo{cite} algorithm covered in Section \todo{ref}. \hide{\todo{Comments about UCT running non-stationary MAB at each node, and how MCTS can be viewed from this perspective}}

        In the literature, UCT and MCTS are often used synonomously, however this leaves some of the specifics of the algorithms used as ambiguous. This thesis presents UCT as it was originally presented in \todo{cite}. In Subsection \todo{ref} the variant of UCT which is commonly referred to as MCTS is given.

        UCT can be defined using the THTS schema outlined in Section \todo{ref} as follows:

        Firstly, UCT as originally presented is run with \mctsmode set to False. As such, all sampled trajectories are sampled until timestep $H$, the finite horizon of the MDP. 

        At each node a the sampled averages $\Vuct$ or $\Quct$ for value estimates.

        The search policy that UCT follows is:
        \begin{align}
            \piuct(s) = \argmax_{a\in\cl{A}} \Quct(s,a) + b_{\uct} \sqrt{\frac{\log(N(s))}{N(s,a)}} \label{eq:uct_policy}
        \end{align}

        where $b_{\uct}$ is a \textit{bias} parameter that controls the amount of exploration UCT will perform. In Equation (\todo{ref}), when $N(s,a)=0$ there is a division by zero, which is taken as $\inf$, and ties are broken uniformly randomly. Note that like UCB (Section \todo{ref}), this results in every action being taken once to obtain an initial value estimate, and as such, setting $\Qinit$ is unnecessary for UCT.   

        After sampling a trajectory $\tau_{:H}\sim\pi_{\uct}$, the sample average value estimates are updated as follows:
        \begin{align}
            \Quct(s_t,a_t) &\leftarrow 
                \frac{1}{N(s_t,a_t)} \left( (N(s_t,a_t)-1) \Quct(s_t,a_t) 
                    + \sum_{i=t}^{H-1} R(s_i,a_i) \right) \\
            \Vuct(s_t) &\leftarrow 
                \frac{1}{N(s_t)} \left( (N(s_t)-1) \Vuct(s_t,a_t) 
                    + \sum_{i=t}^{H-1} R(s_i,a_i) \right) 
        \end{align}  

        For UCT the $\backupv$ and $\backupq$ operations implement Equations (\todo{ref}) and (\todo{ref}) respectively. Because UCT is planning in a finite horizon MDP, the heuristic function will only be called on states that are at the time horizon H. As such, for UCT we can set $\Vinit(s) = 0$. 






    
    \subsection{Monte-Carlo Tree Search}
    \label{sec:2-4-3-mcts}

        \hide{\todo{Rushing through the todo's here so probably needs another round for 2nd pass, not doing any adding labels to defs and equations, not making any diagrams}}

        This subsection covers the variant of UCT that is often referred to as just `MCTS' \todo{cite examples?}, although this thesis and the wider literature tends to refer to any algorithm using Monte Carlo trials as an MCTS algorithm. To be unambiguous, this algorithm will be referred to as UCT-MCTS.

        UCT-MCTS is commonly presented as having four stages to each trial, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:mcts}, which go as follows:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item selection, which samples a trajectory along a path in the search tree until it finds a state not contained by the search tree;
            \item expansion, which creates the new decision node and adds it to the tree;
            \item initialisation, which uses a heuristic function to initialise the sample average value estimate at the new leaf node;
            \item backup, which updates the value estimates at all nodes visited on the trial.
        \end{enumerate}

        \begin{figure}
            \centering\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/todo.jpg} 
            \caption[Overview of one trial of UCT-MCTS.]{Overview of one trial of UCT-MCTS, where \todo{re-describe the four stages similarly to how described inline.}}
            \label{fig:mcts}
        \end{figure}

        The selection, expansion and initialisation phases of UCT-MCTS are encapsulated by the selection phase of \thtspp, where nodes are initalised and added to the tree as necessary.

        The main difference between UCT and UCT-MCTS is that \mctsmode\ewe is turned on in UCT-MCTS, which also means that the heuristic function $\Vinit$ is now used. There are two common approaches to implementing $\Vinit$ in UCT-MCTS: the first consisting of using a function approximation $\tilde{V}_\theta$ and setting $\Vinit=\tilde{V}_\theta$ \todo{cite some papers doing this}, where $\hat{V}_\theta$ aims to approximate the optimal value function $V^*$; and the second approach consists of using a \textit{rollout policy} \todo{cite some papers doing this}. When a rollout policy $\pirollout$ is used, a Monte Carlo estimate $\hat{V}^{\pirollout}$ of the value function $V^{\pirollout}$ is used for $\Vinit$.
        
        Now the remaining details of UCT-MCTS are given. Let $\Vmcts$ and $\Qmcts$ refer to the sample average value estimates used by UCT-MCTS. The UCT-MCTS search policy corresponds to the UCT search policy:
        \begin{align}
            \pi_{\mcts}(s) = \argmax_{a\in\cl{A}} Q_{\mcts}(s,a) + b_{\mcts} \sqrt{\frac{\log(N(s))}{N(s,a)}}.
        \end{align}

        Let $\tau_{:h}\sim\pimcts$, be the trajectory sampled in the selection phase of UCT-MCTS. When using a rollout policy, the truncated trial is completed using the rollout policy $\tau_{h:H}\sim\pirollout$ to provide the Monte Carlo estimate at $s_h$:
        \begin{align}
            \hat{V}^{\pirollout}(s_h) = \sum_{i=h}^{H-1} r_i.
        \end{align}

        In UCT-MCTS the backups $\backupv$ and $\backupq$ update the (sample average) value estimates. Letting heuristic value for the leaf node be $\tilde{r} = \Vinit(s_h)$, they are computed as follows:
        \begin{align}

        Maximum ENtropy Tree Search (MENTS) \todo{cite}, in contrast to UCT, focuses on the maximum-entropy objective, and uses soft Bellman backups (Equations \todo{ref}) to update its value estimates. In its original presentation \mctsmode\ewe is set to True, and it uses the soft value estimates $\Vments$ and $\Qments$. The MENTS search policy is given by:
        \begin{align}
            \piments(a|s) &= 
                (1-\lambda_s)\exp\left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{\ments}}\left(\Qments(s,a)-\Vments(s)\right)\right) 
                    + \frac{\lambda_s}{|\cl{A}|},
        \end{align}
        where $\alpha_{\ments}$ is the temperature paramter used for Equation \todo{ref} in MENTS, and $\lambda_s=\min(1,\epsilon/\log(e+N(s))),$ with $\epsilon \in (0,\infty)$ is an exploration parameter.

        The value estimates are updated using the soft Bellman backups (\todo{ref}) as follows:
        \begin{align}
            \Qments(s_t,a_t) &\leftarrow 
                R(s_t,a_t) + \sum_{s'\in\suc{s}{a}} \left( \frac{N(s')}{N(s_t,a_t)} \Vments(s') \right), \\
            \Vments(s_t) &\leftarrow 
                \alpha \log \sum_{a\in\cl{A}} \exp \left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\Qments(s_t,a) \right).
        \end{align}

        $\Vinit$ 

        In \todo{cite}, it is suggested that the heuristic value function is set using a function approximation $\Vinit=\tilde{V}_\theta$, and that the heuristic action function is set to zero: $\Qinit(s,a)=0$. They also suggest that if \textit{policy network} $\tilde{\pi}$ is available, the the heuristic action function can be set to $\Qinit(s,a)=\log \tilde{\pi}(s|a)$. 

        \todo{Maybe commente here, or refer to where discussed in ch4 (DENTS) work: neither of the options suggested for $\Qinit$ worked well in practise for us, so we set it depending on the environment.}
















\section{Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning}
\label{sec:2-5-morl}

    \hide{\todo{Rushing through the todo's here so probably needs another round for 2nd pass, not doing any adding labels to defs and equations, not making any diagrams}}

    \todo{Link back to some of the multi objective questions}

    This thesis follows a utility based approach to Multi-Objective Reinforcement learning similar to \todo{cite}. For a full review of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning see \todo{cite}. This work will specifically consider \textit{linear utility} functions and the \textit{decision support scenario} (Figure \ref{fig:mo_decision_support}), which will be defined more precisely below.

    \begin{figure}
        \centering\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/todo.jpg} 
        \caption{The decision-support scenario for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning.]{The decision-support scenario for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning.}}
        \label{fig:mo_decision_support}
    \end{figure}

    This section defines the multi-objective conterparts to various definitions in Section \ref{sec:2-1-mdps} and \ref{sec:2-2-rl}. Outside of this section, the prefix ``multi-objective'' may be dropped where it should be clear from context, however bold typeface will consistently be used to denote any vector variables or functions.

    To specify problems with multiple objectives, the reward function of an MDP changed to give a vector of rewards, rather than a scalar reward:
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:mo_mdp}
        A \textnormal{Multi-Objective Markov Decision Process} (MOMDP) is a tuple $\bfcl{M}=(\cl{S},s_0,\cl{A},\bff{R},p,H)$, where $\cl{S}$ is a set of states, $s_0\in\cl{S}$ is an initial state, $\cl{A}$ is a set of actions, $\bff{R}(s,a)$ is a vector reward function $\cl{S}\times \cl{A}\rightarrow \bb{R}^D$, where $D$ is the dimension of the rewards and the MOMDP, $p(s' | s,a)$ is a next state transition distribution $\cl{S} \times \cl{A} \times \cl{S} \rightarrow [0,1]$ and $H\in\bb{N}$ is a finite-horizon time bound.
    \end{defn}

    Now multi-objective trajectories are defined:
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:mo_trajectory}
        A \textnormal{multi-objective trajectory} $\tau$, is a sequence of state, action and vector rewards, that is induced by a policy $\pi$ and MOMDP $\bfcl{M}$ pair. Let the trajectory be $\bff{\tau} = (s_0, a_0, \bff{r}_0, s_1, a_1, \bff{r}_1, ..., s_{H-1}, a_{H-1}, \bff{r}_{H-1}, s_H)$, where $a_t \sim \pi(\cdot|s_t)$, $\bff{r}_t=\bff{R}(s_t,a_t)$ and $s_{t+1} \sim \suc{s_t}{a_t}$. 
        
        The notations used for single-objective trajectories (Definition \ref{def:trajectory}) will also be used for multi-objective trajectories too. Such as, $\bff{\tau}\sim\pi$ for sampling trajectories using policies, and $\bff{\tau}_{i:j}$ for truncated trajectories.
    \end{defn}

    Similarly, multi-objective variants of the (Q-)value of a policy are defined:    
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:mo_value}
        \label{def:mo_q_value}
        The \textnormal{multi-objective value} of a policy $\pi$ from state $s$ at time $t$ is:
        \begin{align}
            \bff{V}^{\pi}(s;t) = \bb{E}_{\bff{\tau}\sim\pi}\left[\sum_{i=t}^{H-1} \bff{r}_t \Bigg| s_t=s \right].
        \end{align} 

        The \textnormal{multi-objective Q-value} of a policy $\pi$, from state $s$, with action $a$, at time $t$ is:
        \begin{align}
            \bff{Q}^{\pi}(s,a;t) = R(s,a) + \bb{E}_{s'\sim \suc{s}{a}} [\bff{V}^{\pi}(s';t+1)].
        \end{align} 
    \end{defn}

    In the corresponding point of the single-objective reinforcement learning section (Section \ref{sec:2-2-rl}), the the optimal (Q-)value functions and the objective of single-objective reinforcement learning were defined. However, in a multi-objective setting there is no longer a \textit{total ordering} over values, and so there maybe be multiple vectors that could be ``optimal''. To resolve this issue, a \textit{utility function} or \textit{scalarisation function} is used to map multi-objective values to scalars.

    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:simplex}
        \label{def:weight}
        \label{def:context}
        The \textnormal{($D$-dimensional) Simplex} consists of the set of $D$-dimensional vectors, whose entries are non-negative and sum to one. More formally, the $D$ dimensional simplex is $\Delta^D = \{\bff{w}\in\bb{R}^D|w_i > 0, \sum_i w_i = 1\}$.

        The elements of the $D$-dimensional Simplex will be referred to as \textnormal{weight vectors} in this thesis, as they will be used to specify preferences over the $D$ dimensions of the reward function.
    \end{defn}

    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:utility_fn}
        \label{def:scalarisation_fn}
        A \textnormal{utility function} (or \textnormal{scalarisation function}) $u:\mathbb{R}^D\times\Delta^D \rightarrow \bb{R}$ is used to map from a multi-objective value $\bff{v}\in\bb{R}^D$ and a weighting over the objectives $\bff{w}\in\Delta^D$ to a scalar value. That is, according to the utility function $u(\cdot;\bff{w})$ the multi-objective value $\bff{v}$ is mapped to the scalar value $u(\bff{v};\bff{w})$.
    \end{defn}

    Of particular interest in this thesis is the \textit{linear utility function} where the scalar value takes the form of a dot-product:
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:linear_utility_fn}
        \label{def:linear_scalarisation_fn}
        The \textnormal{linear utility function} $u_{\lin}$ is the utility function defined by:
        \begin{align}
            u_{\lin}(\bff{v};\bff{w}) = \bff{w}^\top \bff{v}.
        \end{align}
    \end{defn}

    Equiped with a scalarisation function and a weight vector any set of multi-objective values can be ordered, which allows sets of \textit{possibly optimal} policies to be defined. Letting $\Pi$ be the set of all possible policies, sets of solution policies can be defined:
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:undominated_set}
        \label{def:convex_hull}
        The \textnormal{undominated set} of policies $U(\Pi;u)\subseteq\Pi$, with respect to a utility function $u$,  is the set of policies for which there is a weight vector $\bff{w}\in\Delta^D$ where the scalarised value is maximised: 
        \begin{align}
            U(\Pi;u) = \left\{\pi\in\Pi\ \big|\ \exists \bff{w}\in\Delta^D. \forall \pi'\in\Pi: u(\bff{V}^{\pi}(s_0;0);\bff{w}) \geq u(\bff{V}^{\pi'}(s_0;0);\bff{w}) \right\}.
        \end{align}

        In particular, the \textnormal{convex hull} of policies $CH(\Pi)$ is the undominated set with respect to the linear utility function $u_{\lin}$. That is $CH(\Pi)=U(\Pi;u_{\lin})$.
    \end{defn}    

    Undominated sets often have an infinite cardinality, and as such are infeasibil to compute. However, in undominated sets there are often many reduntant policies that obtain the same scalarised values. Instead of computing an undominated set, it is more feasible to compute a \textit{coverage sets} which contain at least one policy that maximises the scalarised value given any weight vector $\bff{w}$:
    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:coverage_set}
        \label{def:convex_coverage_set}
        A set $CS(\Pi;u)\subseteq U(\Pi)$, is a \textnormal{coverage set} with respect to a utility function $u$, if for every weight vector $\bff{w}\in\Delta^D$, there is a policy $\pi\in CS(\Pi;u)$ that maximises the value of $u(\cdot;\bff{w})$. That is, for $CS(\Pi;u)$ to be a coverage set, the following statement must be true:
        \begin{align}
            \forall \bff{w}\in\Delta^D. \exists \pi\in CS(\Pi;u). \forall \pi'\in\Pi: u(\bff{V}^{\pi}(s_0;0);\bff{w}) \geq u(\bff{V}^{\pi'}(s_0;0);\bff{w}).
        \end{align}

        Again, in particular, any set $CCS(\Pi)$ is a \textnormal{convex coverage set} if it is a coverage set with respect to the linear utility function $u_{\lin}$. 
    \end{defn}

    To compute a coverage set, it is often useful to first compute the multi-objective values that could be obtained, and then later use the data structures used by the algorithm to read out the selected policy. 

    \begin{defn}
        \label{def:mo_value_set}
        The \textnormal{(multi-objective) value set} with respect to a set of policies $\Pi'\subseteq\Pi$ is defined as:
        \begin{align}
            \valset(\Pi') = \{\bff{V}^{\pi}(s_0;0) | \pi \in \Pi'\}.
        \end{align}
    \end{defn}

    Because this thesis considers the decision support scenario, the objective of an multi-objective algorithm will be to compute a $\valset(CCS(\Pi))$, however, coverage sets are not unique. In the case of the linear utility function, multi-objective values that obtain the same scalarised value will lie on a hyperplane (see Figure \todo{ref}). As a result, the vectors in $\valset(CCS(\Pi))$ will geometrically form a \textit{(parital) convex hull} (also see Figure \ref{fig:convex_hull_geometry}). Given this, it is most common to compute the multi-objective values that lie at the vertices of the geometric convex hull (also see Figure \ref{fig:convex_hull_geometry}). 

    For the remainder of this thesis, the primary objective of multi-objective algorithms will be to compute the value set $\valset(CCS(\Pi))$ that lies at the vertices of the geometric convex hull, which will be referred to as the \textit{Convex Hull Value Set} (CHVS). \todo{make this a defn, going to use the acronym a lot}

Any set of vectors $\bfcl{V}\subseteq\valset(\Pi)$ that contains a point touching each edge of the geometric convex hull is a valid (value set of a) convex coverage set, and the points that are filled denotes one of such sets. Finally, the circles, which are at  the extreme points of the geometric convex hull mark the (value set of the) convex coverage set that is typically computed.}

        \todo{
            Here are some things that wrote at the end when icky and ill. Also editing this section tired, so maybe consider adding them into the above on another pass, or moving into ch3, or maybe we covered them and just delete:

            Should acknowledge some things. Often we actually compute the value set of a convex coverage set. Often we compute a very specific convex coverage set, which is the extreme points of the convex hull. Also that the term convex hull is typically used to refer to any of the previous three sets (value set, convex coverage set, convex hull). And finally, say that often with methods that compute the value set can often use tagging to compute the policies after the fact, and cite some of the pomdp algorithms from LPK that actually explain the tagging

            Additionally, this thesis focusses on the decision support scenario as outlined in (TODO: cite), with a linear utility function. In the decision support scenario the true weight vector is unknown, and so the objective is to compute a convex coverage set. When a convex coverage set is produced, it is then provided to a user that picks their most preferred policy or value from the coverage set. After this policy is selected, it can be used as a single solution to the problem that the user was trying to solve. 
        
            Moreover, in the case of MCTS algorithms, by having the user select a preferred policy, it implicitly forces the user to chose a preference over the objectives, as the policy corresponds to a weight vector that it is optimal for. As MCTS algorithms are often used in an online fashion, where planning is interleaved with execution, this implicitly selected weight can be used for any online execution needed, effectively reducing the multi-objective problem into a single-objective problem.

    \subsection{Convex Hull Value Iteration}
    \label{sec:2-5-1-chvi}

        Convex Hull Value Iteration (CHVI) \cite{chvi} is a tabular dynamic programming algorithm similar to Value Iteration \todo{ref}. In CHVI the value functions of value iterations are replaced by sets of vectors, which are estimates of the convex hull value set.

        CHVI maintains estimates of CHVS's at each state $\Vchvi(s;t)$.

        One important operation for CHVI is \cprune, which returns that undominated set of vectors from a given set of vectors $\bfcl{V}$:
        \begin{align}
            \cprune(\bfcl{V}) = \{\bff{v}\in\bfcl{V} | \exists \bff{w}\in\Delta^D. \forall \bff{v}'\in\bfcl{V}-\{\bff{v}\}. \bff{w}^\top \bff{v} > \bff{w}^\top \bff{v}' \}.
        \end{align}

        The \cprune\ewe operation can be implemented using \textit{linear programming} \todo{cite}, and an example of its operation on a set of vectors is given in Figure \ref{fig:convex_prune}.

        \begin{figure}
            \centering\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/todo.jpg} 
            \caption[An example of the \cprune\ewe operation.]{An example of the \cprune\ewe operation. The circles and triangles form a vector set $\bfcl{V}$, and the circles denote the set $\cprune(\bfcl{V})$.}
            \label{fig:convex_prune}
        \end{figure}

        Additionally, to define a multi-objective version of value iteration, an arithmetic over sets of vectors needs to be defined. An example of the following arithmetic is given in Figure \ref{fig:vectorset_arithmetic} Given the sets of vectors $\bfcl{U}$ and $\bfcl{V}$, define multiplication by a scalar $s$, addition with a vector $\bff{x}$ and addition between sets as follows:
        \begin{align}
            \bff{x} + s\bfcl{V} &= \{\bff{x} + s\bff{v} | \bff{v}\in\bfcl{V} \} \\
            \bfcl{U} + \bfcl{V} &= \{ \bff{u}+\bff{v} | \bff{u}\in\bfcl{U}, \bff{v}\in\bfcl{V} \}.
        \end{align}

        \begin{figure}
            \centering\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/ch2/ch_arithmetic.pdf} 
            \caption[An example of arithmetic over sets of vectors.]{An example of arithmetic over sets of vectors, where \todo{describe specifics more specifically, and note that addition by a vector is not shown here, but is similar. Also something looks a bit off about the purple vectors, maybe want to add a light grid behind the graphs? Just to give perspective. Reference that this demonstrates the scalar multiplication from equation (xxx) and addition between sets in equation (xxx). And yes, want the grid, but do later}.}
            \label{fig:vectorset_arithmetic}
        \end{figure}

        Now to define the multi-objective Bellman backups used in CHVI, let $\hat{\bfcl{V}}^0(s) = \{ \bff{0} \}$, where $\bff{0}=(0,...,0)\in\bb{R}^D$. The CHVI backups are then:
        \begin{align}
            \Vchvi^{k+1}(s;t) &= \cprune \left( \bigcup_{a\in\cl{A}} \Qchvi^{k+1}(s,a;t) \right), \\
            \Qchvi^{k+1}(s,a;t) &= \bb{E}_{s'\sim \suc{s}{a}} [\bff{R}(s,a) + \Vchvi^k(s';t+1)].
        \end{align}
        
        This again parallels the Bellman backups use in single-objective value iteration \todo{ref}, where the max operation is replaced by the \cprune\ewe operation over the set of achievable values from the current state $s$: $\bigcup_{a\in\cl{A}} \Qchvi^{k+1}(s,a;t)$.

        Extracting actions and policies from the computed CHVSs is not explicitly discussed in \cite{chvi}. However, vectors can be \textit{tagged} with actions which allows for a policy to be read out after selecting a value in a CHVS. Consider \todo{having a CHVS for V and Q, set Qtagged to Q with the action in the Q function, and then say that V is computed same as equation XXX, and for convex prune, if there is (v,a) and (v,a'), then break ties randomly. An example of using this tagging to read out policies is given in Figure} \ref{fig:chvs_tagging}.
        
        \todo{some hidden stuff here to consider?}

\section{Sampling From Catagorical Distributions}

    \todo{this section needs figs still}

    Much of the work in this thesis will involve sampling from catagorical distributions. Let $f:\{1,...,m\}\rightarrow\bb{R}$ be the probability mass function of a catagorical distribution with $m$ categories. Suppose that we want to sample $i\sim f$. A naive method to sample from $f$ will take $O(m)$ time, where a value is sampled from $\textnormal{Uniform}(0,1)$ is often used as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
def sample_catagorical($f$):
    threshold $\sim \textnormal{Uniform}(0,1)$
    i = 0
    accumulated_mass = 0
    while (accumulated_mass < threshold):
        i += 1
        accumulated_mass += $f($i$)$
    return i
    \end{lstlisting}
    \todo{add label and caption for listing}
    % TODO: make a figure env for code

    However, the \textit{Alias method} \todo{cite1, cite2} can instead be used, with $O(m)$ preprocessing time to construct an \textit{Alias table}, and can sample from $f$ in $O(1)$ time. In Figure \todo{ref} we provide an example of an alias table. A value can be sampled using the alias table by sampling two random numbers, one from $\textnormal{Uniform}(\{1,...,m\})$ and one from $\textnormal{Uniform}(0,1)$. To sample from the alias table, one of the entries is sampled uniformly randomly using the sample from $\textnormal{Uniform}(\{1,...,m\})$, each entry in the table contains three values, \texttt{threshold}, \texttt{cat\_one} and \texttt{cat\_two}, from which if we let $a\sim\textnormal{Uniform}(0,1)$, we would then return \texttt{cat\_one} if $a<$\texttt{threshold} and \texttt{cat\_two} otherwise. Psuedocode for this is as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
def sample_from_alias_table(alias_table):
    index $\sim \textnormal{Uniform}(\{1,...,m\})$
    cat_one, cat_two, threshold = alias_table[index]
    a $\sim \textnormal{Uniform}(0,1)$
    if (a < threshold):
        return cat_one 
    return cat_two
    \end{lstlisting}
    \todo{add label and caption for listing}

    In \todo{cite} it is shown \todo{double check that it's proven} that an alias table can be constructed from an arbitrary probability mass function for a catagorical distribution, such that the probability of sampling any catagory from the alias table is identical to the probability of sampling it from the original probability mass function. 
    
    \todo{add fig, and in caption verify that the example alias table maintains the correct masses for each category}

    Following \todo{cite}, we can construct an alias table as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
def build_alias_table($f$):
    pass
    \end{lstlisting}
    \todo{add label and caption for listing}
